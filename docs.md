### 1. Introduction: Why Learn Node.js?

**The Concept of Full Stack**:

- Definition: Involves both frontend (user interface) and backend (server, database) development.
- Importance: Mastering both areas allows a developer to build complete applications, a skill highly valued in the industry.

**JavaScript Everywhere**:

- Benefits of using JavaScript on both frontend and backend:
  1. **Consistency**: Fewer context switches increase productivity.
  2. **Shared Code**: Logic or utilities can be reused between frontend and backend.
  3. **Unified Knowledge**: No need to switch mental models or learn a different language's syntax.

**Performance of Node.js**:

- Node.js features an event-driven architecture, efficiently handling many connections simultaneously.
- Its non-blocking I/O avoids waiting on tasks, making operations swift.

**The Ecosystem - npm (Node Package Manager)**:

- npm is the world's largest software registry.
- Provides access to thousands of libraries and tools, accelerating development.

### 2. The History of Node.js

**Origins of Node.js**:

- Developed by **Ryan Dahl** in 2009.
- Motivated by dissatisfaction with existing server technologies and their handling of I/O operations.

**Google's V8 JavaScript Engine**:

- V8 is a high-performance JavaScript engine developed by Google for Chrome.
- Node.js leverages V8, enabling rapid server-side JavaScript execution.

**Growth and Popularity**:

- Adopted by major tech companies, including Netflix, LinkedIn, and Walmart.
- The Node.js Foundation was established in 2015, fostering its growth.
- Continuous community contributions have led to its rapid evolution and the extensive npm ecosystem.

**Event-Driven, Non-Blocking Architecture**:

- This architecture addressed common web server issues, especially when managing many simultaneous connections.

### 3. Setting Up Node.js

**Installation**:

- Visit the official [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and download the appropriate version for your operating system.
- There are two primary versions available:
  - **LTS (Long Term Support)**: Stable and recommended for most users.
  - **Current**: Contains the latest features but might not be as stable as LTS.
- After installation, verify it by opening your terminal or command prompt and running:

  ```bash
  node -v
  npm -v
  ```

  This will display the installed versions of Node.js and npm, respectively.

**Node.js Runtime**:

- Node.js allows you to execute JavaScript outside of a browser.
- Example: Create a file named `hello.js` and write the following code:

  ```javascript
  console.log("Hello from Node.js!");
  ```

  Execute the script using:

  ```bash


  node hello.js
  ```

**Node REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop)**:

- Node REPL is an interactive shell for executing JavaScript.
- Access it by typing `node` in your terminal. Within the REPL, you can type any valid JavaScript expression.
- To exit the REPL, press `Ctrl + C` twice or type `.exit`.

**npm (Node Package Manager)**:

- npm is the default package manager for JavaScript and Node.js.
- Every Node.js project has a `package.json` file, which tracks project dependencies and other configurations.
- Create a new Node.js project by navigating to your desired directory and running:

  ```bash
  npm init
  ```

  Follow the prompts to set up your project.

- Install external packages/libraries using:

  ```bash
  npm install <package-name>
  ```

Great! Moving on to the introduction of Express.js.

---

### 4. Introduction to Express.js

**Why Express.js?**:

- Express simplifies the process of building web applications on top of Node.js.
- It provides a lightweight framework to set up servers, define routes, and handle requests and responses.

**Setting Up a Basic Express Server**:

1. Install Express using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install express
   ```

2. Create a new file, `server.js`, and write the following code:

   ```javascript
   const express = require("express");
   const app = express();

   app.get("/", (req, res) => {
   	res.send("Hello from Express!");
   });

   const PORT = 3000;
   app.listen(PORT, () => {
   	console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
   });
   ```

3. Run the server with:

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

**Handling Routes, Middlewares, and Responses**:

- Routes define the endpoints of your application. For example, `/`, `/about`, `/users`.
- Middlewares are functions that can access the request and response objects. They can perform tasks like logging, authentication, or modifying the request data.
- Responses can be in various formats like text, JSON, or HTML. With Express, you can easily send different types of responses using methods like `res.send()`, `res.json()`, or `res.render()`.

### Building a Node.js API: From Problem to Solution

**1. Starting Point: Basic Express Server**

Set up a basic Express server:

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
const PORT = 3000;

// Middleware to parse JSON requests
app.use(express.json());

// Sample data
let users = [
	{ id: 1, name: "John Doe" },
	{ id: 2, name: "Jane Smith" },
];

// GET endpoint to fetch all users
app.get("/users", (req, res) => {
	res.json(users);
});

// POST endpoint to add a new user
app.post("/users", (req, res) => {
	const newUser = {
		id: users.length + 1,
		name: req.body.name,
	};
	users.push(newUser);
	res.status(201).json(newUser);
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
	console.log(`Server running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});
```

You're right. Some fundamental libraries like `nodemon` and others help streamline the development process and enhance the developer experience. Let's cover these:

---

### Essential Libraries & Tools for Node.js Development

1. **Nodemon**:

   - **Purpose**: It's a utility that monitors for any changes in your source code and automatically restarts your server, making the development process smoother.
   - **Usage**:
     ```bash
     npm install nodemon --save-dev
     ```
     In your `package.json` scripts, replace the start script:
     ```json
     "scripts": {
       "start": "nodemon server.js"
     }
     ```

2. **Dotenv**:

   - **Purpose**: Allows you to load environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`. This is essential for managing sensitive information like database connection strings, API keys, and more.
   - **Usage**:
     ```bash
     npm install dotenv
     ```
     At the top of your main server file (e.g., `server.js`):
     ```javascript
     require("dotenv").config();
     ```

Certainly! `Morgan` is a middleware for logging HTTP requests in your Node.js applications. It's handy for monitoring incoming requests, especially in a development environment.

Here's how to set up and use `Morgan`:

---

### Morgan: HTTP Request Logger for Node.js

**Installation**:

To begin with, you need to install the `morgan` package:

```bash
npm install morgan
```

**Basic Usage**:

1. First, you need to require `morgan` and integrate it into your Express application:

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const morgan = require("morgan");

const app = express();

// Use Morgan middleware with the 'dev' format
app.use(morgan("dev"));
```

2. Start your server, and for every HTTP request, you'll see a log entry in your terminal. The `'dev'` format is just one of many predefined formats that `morgan` provides.

**Predefined Formats**:

Morgan comes with several predefined formats that control the output style:

- `'combined'`: Standard Apache combined log output.
- `'common'`: Standard Apache common log output.
- `'dev'`: Concise output colored by response status for development use.
- `'short'`: Shorter than default, also colored by response status.
- `'tiny'`: The minimal output.

**Example**:

If you want to use the `'combined'` format, just replace `'dev'` with `'combined'`:

```javascript
app.use(morgan("combined"));
```

**Custom Formats**:

You can also define your custom format. For example, to print just the method and URL:

```javascript
app.use(morgan(":method :url"));
```

---

With `Morgan`, you can easily keep an eye on your application's incoming requests, helping in debugging and understanding the usage patterns. In a production environment, you might want to integrate `Morgan` with a more advanced logging system to store logs or stream them to external services.

### MongoDB: Fundamental Operations and Terminologies

**1. Terminology**:

- **Database**: A MongoDB instance can host multiple databases. Each database is a set of collections, similar to how traditional databases host tables.

- **Collection**: Equivalent to a table in relational databases. It holds a set of documents.

- **Document**: A single data entity with fields and values, similar to a row in relational databases. Documents are stored in JSON-like format called BSON.

- **Field**: A name-value pair inside a document. Similar to a column in relational databases.

---

**2. Basic Database Operations**:

- **Create a New Database**:

  ```javascript
  use myNewDatabase;
  ```

  **Description**: This command switches to the specified database. If the database doesn't exist, MongoDB will create it once you add data.

- **List All Databases**:

  ```javascript
  show dbs;
  ```

  **Description**: Displays a list of all databases on the MongoDB server.

- **Switch Between Databases**:

  ```javascript
  use anotherDatabase;
  ```

  **Description**: Switches to the specified database.

- **Drop a Database**:
  ```javascript
  db.dropDatabase();
  ```
  **Description**: Deletes the current database.

---

**3. Collections Management**:

- **Create a Collection**:
  MongoDB creates collections automatically when you insert data. However, you can also create them explicitly:

  ```javascript
  db.createCollection("myCollection");
  ```

  **Description**: Creates a new collection named "myCollection" in the current database.

- **List All Collections**:

  ```javascript
  show collections;
  ```

  **Description**: Displays a list of all collections in the current database.

- **Drop a Collection**:
  ```javascript
  db.myCollection.drop();
  ```
  **Description**: Deletes the specified collection and its data.

---

**4. Documents Management**:

- **Insert a Document**:

  ```javascript
  db.myCollection.insertOne({ name: "Alice", age: 25 });
  ```

  **Description**: Inserts a single document into the specified collection.

- **Find Documents**:

  ```javascript
  db.myCollection.find();
  ```

  **Description**: Retrieves all documents from the specified collection.

- **Update a Document**:

  ```javascript
  db.myCollection.updateOne({ name: "Alice" }, { $set: { age: 26 } });
  ```

  **Description**: Updates the first document that matches the query.

- **Delete a Document**:
  ```javascript
  db.myCollection.deleteOne({ name: "Alice" });
  ```
  **Description**: Deletes the first document that matches the query.

---

**5. Indexing**:

- **Create an Index**:

  ```javascript
  db.myCollection.createIndex({ name: 1 });
  ```

  **Description**: Creates an ascending index on the "name" field of the specified collection. Indexing speeds up query performance.

- **List All Indexes**:
  ```javascript
  db.myCollection.getIndexes();
  ```
  **Description**: Displays a list of all indexes on the specified collection.
